# The-really-extremely-dumb-bot
rewritten lua bot in go using the discordgo library
 ## how 2 install
 - in the terminal while also in the folder of main.go, type go mod init (insert any name u wish)
 - go to https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo for instructions on how to install the library
 - don't question me if it errors bc you are probably most likely doing it wrong

## features
- read messages
- react to messages with words with words
- commands that will satisfy you more than your gf in bed (or bf)
- better than yeti bot and dirty bot (legit just a bunch of lazy if statements + this bot is opensource + is written in go)
- not bloat because it is written in go

## suggestions
- put them in issues I guess
- don't fork and make a pull request because I won't accept


## this bot is so bad lmao
- lol okay shut up
