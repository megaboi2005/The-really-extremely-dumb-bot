# The-really-extremely-dumb-bot
very dumb, written in luvit (lua but on coke) using the discordia library
 ## how 2 install
 - go to https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia
 - everything is there so don't @ me

## features
- read messages
- react to messages with words with words
- commands that will satisfy you more than your gf in bed
- better than yeti bot (legit just a bunch of lazy if statements + this bot is opensource)
- not bloat

## suggestions
- put them in issues I guess
- make a fork and pull request 
- maybe I'll accept 

## this bot is so bad lmao
- ok, didn't ask also I didn't need that information also + bozo + no fatherly figure + you use twitter daily + you can't possibly do better than me + you have no friends.
